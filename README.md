# Dashboard workshop starter

The starting point for **Building a Live Data Quality Dashboard with Claude Code**, a hands-on
workshop by [Exagrow](https://exagrow.com) at [DAMA Days 2026](https://www.dama-mn.org/DAMA-Days-2026).

There is almost nothing here on purpose. You and Claude build the dashboard together during
the workshop. What is here is the groundwork:

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), the ground rules Claude follows while you work.
- [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md), the plan for your dashboard. Claude fills it in with you before
  building: who it is for, the questions it answers, the quality checks, and how you will
  know it is done.
- [`.claude/skills/analyze-data-quality/`](.claude/skills/analyze-data-quality/SKILL.md), a
  skill you run as `/analyze-data-quality`. It takes a dataset from picking dimensions through
  to a dashboard built on the results.
- Four more skills Claude reaches for while it builds:
  [`jobs-quote-ux`](.claude/skills/jobs-quote-ux/SKILL.md) (start from the person and work
  backwards to the technology),
  [`closed-loop-visual-feedback`](.claude/skills/closed-loop-visual-feedback/SKILL.md) (render
  it, look at it, fix it, repeat),
  [`ux-heuristics`](.claude/skills/ux-heuristics/SKILL.md) (a usability check against Nielsen's
  ten heuristics), and
  [`inverse-set-kondo`](.claude/skills/inverse-set-kondo/SKILL.md) (declutter rules, checks,
  and code by making every piece earn its way back).
- [`data/raw/`](data/raw/README.md), the local data cache. Raw data files go here and never
  leave your laptop; git ignores them.
- [`design-system/`](design-system/README.md), a plain default style: fonts, light and dark
  colors, a placeholder logo, and icons. Claude will ask whether you have your company's own.

## Before the workshop

1. A Claude Pro account, and Claude Desktop installed.
2. A personal laptop, or a work laptop where you have local admin rights.

We will take it from there together in the room.

## License

Everything in this repository is under the MIT License: the skills, `CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN.md`,
and the design system. Use it, change it, and build your own dashboard on it, at work
included. The terms are in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

Three things are outside that, because they are not in this repository:

- **Your data.** Whatever you put in `data/raw/` stays yours, or its publisher's. The
  workshop's trip data is New York City's.
- **The fonts and icons the design system names.** Inter, JetBrains Mono, and Lucide are
  not bundled here. Each comes under its own open license from its own source.
- **The Exagrow name and logo.** The license covers the files, not the brand.
